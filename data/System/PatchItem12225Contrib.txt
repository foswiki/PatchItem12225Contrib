---+!! PatchItem12225Contrib

%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

---++ Usage

This extension installs a patch to support new style version strings in older versions of Foswiki. It also resolves an issue where extensions are re-installed due to 
dependencies on old Subversion revision levels.   This extension was previously named PatchFoswikiContrib.   If you currently have PatchFoswikiContrib version 1.5 or older installed, then this patch is not
required.

When this extension is installed, the Post-installation exit applies the following patch files found in the manifest.  This extension ships with a hotfix for the following items:

| *Original Issue* | *Patch File* | *Description* |
| [[http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item12225][Item12225]] | =Item11267-001= | Extensions released with new style Perl version strings prevents installation of any further extensions. |
| [[http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item11267][Item11267]] | =Item11267-002= | Extensions are re-installed because of dependency on svn Revision levels. |

Patches are only applied if the target file is an _exact_ match to the original file.  There is no attempt to do "fuzzy" patching.   Note however that a patch can be built to cover multiple versions of the file.

There is no "dependency" between patches.  Patches are installed in order of their patch file name.  In the above patch list, =Item11267-001.patch= makes unrelated changes to the file patched in =Item11267-002.patch=, but __must__ be installed first so that the patch signatures match.

Patches will be mapped from the default Foswiki filename to the directory location used on the target system.

Before any file is patched, a backup is copied to =working/configure/backup/&lt;Itemxxxx-nnn-YYYMMDD-HHMMSS&gt;=.  If archive tools are found on the system, a zip or tar archive is created of the backup.
